           <p>We want you to love what you’ve ordered, but just in case, online purchases can be returned to any Janie and Jack store in the U.S. (excluding Outlet stores and closing stores) or through the mail. Merchandise may also be returned if defective, or unwashed and unworn, with or without a receipt. Did we mention that all U.S. returns ship free? Once we’ve processed your return, your refund typically will post within 1–2 billing cycles. All sales are final after 45 days. For returns or exchanges on sets, all items in the set must be returned to be processed accurately. Items that are damaged or defective may be returned or exchanged at any time.</p>
